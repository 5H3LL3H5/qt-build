[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/darkmattercoder/qt-build.svg?branch=deploy)](https://travis-ci.com/darkmattercoder/qt-build)

**Warning, currently under heavy development. The docker file is by no means optimized but should get in the next days. If you fell over this project accidentially please come back in a few days...**

A (nearly) full qt build environment using docker. Using multi-stage build to decouple build from actual image.
